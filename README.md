# PremierLeagueAppDB
This javafx application displays player statistics for players for a selected team.  
The player data is stored in a mysql database named PLeagueDB
The gui prompts the user to select a team which presents all the players on that team along with each player's
Profile: Team, Name, Age, Position, Points.
The database connection is made by the DBConnection class
The gui is designed in the dbproject fxml.  The gui consists of Label a textfield, dropdowns and a tableview.
The gui is controlled by the Controller class.  This class performs all the actions for each feature on the gui
The Table class creates the objects to populate the TableView cells
This is the version.1 I intend to add more functional features and styles in future versions.
